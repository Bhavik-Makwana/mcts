# MCTS Tic-Tac-Toe

A Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) implementation for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Overview

This project implements the MCTS algorithm to create an AI player for Tic-Tac-Toe. The algorithm uses the UCB1 formula to balance exploration and exploitation when selecting moves.

## Features

- MCTS algorithm with UCB1 selection
- Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation
- Interactive gameplay (MCTS vs random player)

## Usage

Run the game:
```bash
python tictactoe.py
```

The game pits an MCTS-powered player (X) against a random player (O).
